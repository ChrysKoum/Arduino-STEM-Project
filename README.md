# About MeshDuino

MeshDuino is an educational toolkit designed to introduce students to engineering principles, coding, physics, and basic networking concepts using a mesh network of Arduinos. This platform uses hands-on experiments to demonstrate how individual devices operate and interact within a network to perform complex tasks, making learning both fun and informative.

## Getting Started

To begin using MeshDuino, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ChrysKoum/MeshDuino.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the MeshDuino source directory:
   ```
   cd ChrysKoum/MeshDuino/src
   ```
3. Run the launcher file:
   ```
   python Launcher.py
   ```

This will start the MeshDuino application where you can engage with various challenges and view the leaderboard of participants.
