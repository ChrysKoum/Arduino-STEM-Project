# About MeshDuino

MeshDuino is an educational toolkit designed to introduce students to engineering principles, coding, physics, and basic networking concepts using a mesh network of Arduinos. This platform uses hands-on experiments to demonstrate how individual devices operate and interact within a network to perform complex tasks, making learning both fun and informative.
